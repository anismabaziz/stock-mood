      "title": "Sum of the parts Valuation for Alphabet (GOOG/GOOGL)",
      "content": "We've all seen plenty of Google posts on Reddit, but most of the comments are a single line thesis about how they're super undervalued or how they're the next Kodak. \n\nI'm interested in your sum-of-the-parts valuation for each business segment. Let's see some details though, not just \"Waymo is really cool so it's worth a trillion dollars.\" Let's see your estimates for growth, your price to earnings/sales, your DCF's, etc... \n\nI'd love to see a few compelling arguments from the bull perspective and the bear perspective, show me what you think! \n\nEdit: I'll start with mine. \n\nSearch- Assuming search grows around 3-4% per year based on a combination of falling click-through rates and raising prices. I would assign around a 10x multiple for the earnings for the huge uncertainty on the horizon. Margins are incredible however, I would estimate around 40%, possibly higher. This would equate to about 80 billion in profit, so let's say search is worth around 800B.\n\nYouTube- TTM ad revenue around 36 billion, I'm hesitant to say this is high margin given the creator ad revenue split and the high hosting costs. However, with 125 million premium subscribers making them approximately 12-15 billion per year, let's just say the ads revenue sustains them at break even, and the subscription is pure profit. Assign a 30x earnings multiple (fair for the huge moat and pricing power), and you get somewhere near a 400B segment.\n\nCloud- The future crown jewel of Alphabet IMO, it's difficult to say what sort of margins they can achieve in the future, but AWS and Azure are IMMENSELY profitable. Let's assume 30% to be conservative? I also think GCP will average around 20% growth for quite a while, given their custom hardware and AI tools. I hate using price to sales, but I would happily pay 12x revenues for the multiple expanding moats, rapid growth, and enormous profitability. That puts cloud at around 540B. \n\nGoogle networks- shrinking business that's significantly less profitable than search, so we'll assume maybe 20% profit margin? I'd say 7x earnings for an estimated 6B per year business that is slowly shrinking equates to around 40B.\n\nOther -We'll just sum up every other operating segment into one giant ball here. You have Waymo, platforms/devices (already discussed youtube subscriptions), Google one subscriptions, and other somewhat un-monetized services like Gmail, maps, Gemini free versions, etc. It's extremely difficult to arrive at a conclusion with any precision here, so let's be conservative and say all of this is worth around 75B or so?\n\nBalance sheet and ventures- the balance sheet has ~300B in shareholder equity right now after zeroing out goodwill. Let's be ultra conservative and assume the total worth of their cash, equipment, buildings, land, fiber, satellites, data centers, etc. is around 100B net of liabilities. Ventures include partial ownership of SpaceX, Anthropic, stripe, and other very promising companies. Again, we'll err on the side of caution and say around 20B of value in their ventures portfolio? \n\nSo, in total, this gives me a current value of just under 2 trillion with what I think are very conservative estimates. I believe basically every segment could underwhelm, and you'd still end up with a respectable return in 10 years time. ",

This feels ridiculous, but I am often profoundly ignorant when it comes to stocks, so someone will probably point out why it's a good idea/required/a sacrifice to the gods/etc.\n\nSecondly, I am at a loss as to why there is *ever* a significant gap between the two ... let alone one in favor of the non-voting shares.  The only two reasons I can think of is laziness and/or confusion.  It's like having two gas stations right next to each other sharing the same driveway, they should either be exactly the same price-per-gallon or so close that by the time you finish driving up to the cheaper option, the more expensive one has already moved its price downwards.",

      "title": "I think Alphabet (GOOGL) is the most undervalued stock in the stock market right now",
      "content": "I am 100% invested in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. \n\n1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is on the way to below 20 and laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. \n\n3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.\n\n2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. \n\n3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. \n\n4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.\n\n5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.\n\n6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue \"short squeeze\" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",

And yet, their P/E multiple is less than the S&P 500 average P/E. Do we really think GOOGLE is just an average of the top 500 large companies in the US? Hell no. So I want to invest $100K into it. I currently own about $10K of leaps for Jan 2026. Wondering if people would recommend $80K in straight GOOGL (or GOOG) stock, then another $20K in long term options (leaps) ranging in strike price from $140-$225? What would be your split? What type of strike prices would you target for options?  \n\n",

That means out of the $237 billion, around $142 billion revenue is generated from the search engine or search ads.\n\n- Google's total revenue for 2023 was $305 billion, that means the revenue from the search engine only (not entire Google ads) makes around 45% of Google's total revenue.\n\nNow the second search engine behind Google is Microsoft Bing, Microsoft generated in 2023 only $12 Billion from Bing ads.\n\nGoogle by far is the dominant as for now, and Microsoft although in the second place behind them, won't be able to reach even a quarter of Google's revenue, they had many failed attempts to promote Bing.\n\nNow some of you probably heared about the upcoming releases of SearchGPT, whoever tried ChatGPT will know it's by far better than Gemini and the other AI models, if Openai released their SearchGPT and people switched from Google search to SearchGPT (which I personally think will happen), Google in this case will keep 45% of its total revenue vulnerable by SearchGPT.\n\nTL;DR Google have strong exposure to its search engine, the revenue generated from the search engine is around 45% of its total revenue, with the upcoming release of SearchGPT, Google may lose its dominance in the long term which may cause their revenue growth to stop or decline.\n\nNot a finacial advice ",

      "content": "For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now. \n\nI think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.\n\nBack to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.  \n\nYears ago, a paper titled \"Attention is all you need\" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy. \n\nPlease send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.",

      "content": "( current investment = \\~1000 in GOOG and GOOGL )\n\nI really like google due to two reasons: **its \"conglomerate-like\" build, as well as its experimentation.**\n\nWith major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive & Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).\n\nGoogle also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as \"the place to go for long-form video watching.\" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. \n\n**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.\n\nGoogle's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.\n\nThe **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.\n\n**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.\n\nGoogle has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. \n\nGoogle is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.\n\nGoogle also has several different speculative \"moonshots\" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an \"unconventional\" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.\n\nHence, why I like the GOOG and GOOGL stock :)",

      "content": "It should be obvious by now that GOOGL has a product problem. They have released quite  a lot of products only to fail to follow up on them and die out or have some other company come in and take the lead.\n\nThey are supposed to have some really smart people but they can't seem to turn these products into successful ones. \n\nYou can take a look at how many products and services they have released over the years only to miserably fail one after another ( www.killedbygoogle.com )\n\nThat said, Google has a pretty good record in the past (Gmail, search, maps, android etc) but they have stalled big time and haven't had any products that can make them a ton of money hence why I consider the company as a one trick pony one. I can't remember when was the last time they released something and gained momentum. Granted, you could just as easily say the same for APPL but they still put out products reminding people they are still very much relevant. When was the last time you got excited over a google product release? Did pixel hit the front page of anything? Doubt it. \n\nA case could be made for cloud but still every time people talk about the cloud, the discussion is usually between AWS and Azure with Google cloud coming in 3rd and potentially have market share taken from it over the next years. \n\nThey have got a long list of failed projects by jumping into every kind of business only to fail to monetize something. Their best products are the ones are the ones they've had for a long time such as Gmail, maps etc. \nI think it all comes down to the management and as far as I'm concerned, I do think that GOOGL ceo is probably the worst ceo out of the big tech. \n\nWhat do you think of GOOGL as we go into the future and what's to come for the big tech?",

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.\n\nNVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).\n\nGOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.\n\nMSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

      "content": "I am mainly posting this to see if I'm missing something or perhaps gravely underestimating the power that this Googl privacy change will have on $TTD and internet advertising as a whole.\n\nIf you've been following $TTD the last few weeks they recently obliterated through earnings and revenue to the tune of 97% EPS beat and \\~10% revenue beat. The dip that followed is actually pretty typical of TTD stock as analysts digest earnings and then the stock usually rallies...which it did until the last two JPow speeches. In part of the broad based NASDAQ sell off $TTD was dragged as expected, however the next day when the NASDAQ was still selling, albeit at a lower pace, $TTD was plummeting on an overall sentiment change in Tech and the GOOGL privacy changes.\n\nWhat makes this all interesting to me is this - the GOOGL privacy change has been known for over a year (see CEO of $TTD address this over a year ago in January of 2020: [https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement](https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/knowledge-center/in-human-terms-episode-9-google-chrome-announcement)). The latest revelation about browsing histories really isn't the seismic shift the market is saying it is as of this week - this has been expected for some time. The other argument I hear is that GOOGL added to their privacy press release skepticism over UID 2.0 which $TTD has been spearheading for greater privacy concerns...hmmmmm why would GOOGL knock a competitors approach to something they lagged on and are now trying to jetison as they try and become the \"standard\" for privacy concerns they've violated for the better part of a decade? When the EU started cracking down on Privacy way before the US this was a boon for $TTD...now the market is telling me it's a detriment?\n\nLastly, I figured that $TTD must rely solely, or heavily, on third party data that is being scrutinized? Although $TTDs platform does integrate with the largest and most robust third party data providers, it is not the pillar of their business that would lead to it's demise. In fact, one of their strongest products is adapting client first party data into useful advertising data. Hence their partnership with $WMT on developing their website advertising platform that will allow for manufacturers to advertise through $WMTs website during the customer experience to drive cross and upsells.\n\nI am most definitely seeking confirmation bias but I am also looking for those to poke holes in what I'm thinking. Were they growing into their valuation? I would say yes, they were probably a bit ahead of their share price when it started decreasing, but given their YoY growth, high margins that are continuing, and positioning in a space that is only growing...I just feel like they are being over punished and that this is a buying opportunity more than it is a retreat from an ATH that will never be sniffed again. I could be wrong - again, confirmation bias is powerful enough for me to write this at 4:57 a.m.",

This means that the voting share class traded at a discount of $9.08, or 0.43%, compared to the non-voting share class.\n\nThis isn't just a one-time fluke either. The voting premium turned into a voting discount on August 13th, 2020, and since then GOOGL has traded at a discount compared to GOOG for 126 out of 127 trading days.\n\nAt market close on April 28th, 2015, just after the most recent stock split, the voting premium was $10.69, or 1.9%. The voting premium has been as high as $29.80 (or 3.73%) in 2016, but has been steadily declining for a while.\n\nWhat can explain the voting discount? As far as I can tell, class A and class C have the same economic interest rights, with the voting rights being the only distinction between the share classes. Even if you don't value the voting rights at all (which is a reasonable perspective, given the decisive insider control), surely the voting rights shouldn't have a _negative_ value?\n\nIt seems Alphabet is buying back their class C shares, but not their class A shares. Is this a sufficient explanation for the price difference? I would expect that hedge funds would see this as an arbitrage opportunity, and would balance out the supply/demand for class A / class C if the price of class A dips below that of class C.",

      "content": "Hey Guys!\n\nHappy Good Friday, as we all know the markets are closed, but I couldn't stop myself looking at potential new opportunities for investments. Upon my search I discovered that Alphabet Inc. (Google) Class A ($1205.03) is actually cheaper than its Class C ($1212.56).\n\nI understand that Class A & B are targeted more toward long term investors and C classes are for those who don't have as much money such as myself but why would class C be more expensive? Could anyone shed some light on this as I'm new to the trading scene and keen to learn!\n\nCheers Dan.",

      "content": "Alphabet stock has dropped 27% after going on a massive bull run at the end of last year/start of this year. Currently trading at $1,110, it's the same price it was trading at in January of 2018 (two years ago). During the quarter ending December 31st 2017 Alphabet's revenue was 32b compared to the 46b in the 2019 December Quarter. That means despite the 43% revenue increase over two years the share price has been discounted to an equal amount.\n\nI understand the current virus has created dire stock trading circumstances. People are reluctant to spend, googles travel services are experiencing a drop in traffic and businesses might tighten the screws on their advertising spending. Despite all this I find it hard to understand why Alphabet has dropped so much. Google makes money off of online services of which everyone under quarantine and lock down can still access and the virus may even increase online traffic. Google's hardware division is so minuscule that disruptions to the supply chain could barely affect google's current quarter financial's let alone the future. Cultural shifts toward working from home and a greater reliance on cloud services for businesses could only help alphabet's financial performance. \n\nMy question is, although Alphabet's performance may be affected this quarter and most likely this fiscal year, what are the long term risks of buying Alphabet's stock at it's current price? How is it not a bargain?",

I personally think, based on TA, FB and GOOGL would possibly have a slight recovery but ultimately drop for the next couple days. Currently I see the price levels being oversold; though it can produce false signals. SPY would decline because trade deal isn't looking so good, esp. China becoming more aggressive. My speculation is IF another correction is due, I wouldn't expect SPY to drop further than 250; I would consider this level to be the maximum. I don't think the trade deal is big of an issue that's going to be the reason for greater correction (where people target SP500 to drop insane amount like 15%, 25%, even 40%). In economic standpoint, trade deal has the potential for massive drop, but I just don't see that the deal with China is gonna be SO BAD that it'll cause a massive selloff. If fed raise another rate, on top of this deal going completely shit (which it might) then that would ideally be it. I would appreciate any opinions and outlook. Thanks in advance!!!",
