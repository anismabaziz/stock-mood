# Reddit Stock Sentiment Analyzer üß†üìà

This is a full-stack web application that performs sentiment analysis on the top 100 posts from the [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) subreddit using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model with **FinBERT embeddings**. It is built with a **FastAPI** backend and a **React (Vite)** frontend.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç Fetches and displays the top 100 posts from r/stocks subreddit.
- üß† Classifies each post as **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** using an MLP model.
- üìà Uses FinBERT (pre-trained on financial text) for generating embeddings.
- ‚ö° Built with FastAPI for robust backend performance.
- ‚öõÔ∏è Clean and fast React interface via Vite.

## üß† Machine Learning Model

- **Model Type**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Embeddings**: FinBERT
- **Training Data**: Labeled financial news articles (not Reddit-specific)
- **Accuracy**: ~80% on the validation set

> FinBERT was used to convert raw text into contextualized embeddings. These embeddings were then used to train a lightweight MLP for classification.
